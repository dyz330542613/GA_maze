a) Traditional Genetic Algorithm: 

1. Run python program named "ga_path". 
2. Configure number of grids and click "Display Path" button to display the path generated by Traditional Genetic Algorithm. 
3. Iterations could be seen in the console. 



b) Adaptive Genetic Algorithm: 

1. Run python program named "ga_path_improve". 
2. Configure number of grids and click "Display Path" button to display the path generated by Adaptive Genetic Algorithm. 
3. Iterations could be seen in the console.
